## Bright Pastel Icons

Theme for the Lapce editor

Includes a number of icons from multiple different packs a list can be seen in the credits.
The vase majority of these icons have been re-colored to more pastel shades. The colors are based on the "Livley Pastel" theme from the Pastel Collection color schemes

There may be some icons missing if that is the case let me know and I will update the plugin
